# :file_folder: CS50x2021
These are my own work for labs and assginments of CS50x2021 by Harvard College/OpenCourseWare.

In each week, there is a summary of knowledge that is worth to know and practice, as well as some extra shorts, videos or links I find helpful along the way to study for CS50.

Course materials:
- [This is CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/)
- [CS50's Manual](https://manual.cs50.io/#stdio.h)
- [CS50's All the docs](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/)
- [Discord discussion](https://discord.com/invite/cs50)
- [Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/cs50/)

Enjoy and Happy coding! :robot:
