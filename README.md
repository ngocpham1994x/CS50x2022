# :file_folder: CS50x2021
These are my own work for labs and assginments of CS50x2021 by Harvard College/OpenCourseWare.
In each week, there is a summary of knowledge that is worth to know and practice, as well as some extra videos or links I find helpful along the way to study for CS50.

Happy coding! :robot:
